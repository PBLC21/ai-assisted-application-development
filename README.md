# AI-Assisted Application Development

## Overview
This project demonstrates an applied approach to **AI-assisted software development**, where large language models (LLMs) are used as engineering support tools within a controlled, human-in-the-loop workflow.
The system focuses on leveraging generative AI to accelerate development tasks—such as code generation, refactoring, and feature scaffolding—while maintaining human ownership of system design, validation, and integration.
This repository emphasizes **engineering discipline**, reproducibility, and responsible use of generative AI in application development.
---
## Key Objectives
- Explore practical use of LLMs as developer assistants
- Maintain human control over architecture and implementation decisions
- Evaluate and refine AI-generated code before integration
- Demonstrate repeatable, reviewable development workflows
---
## Core Concepts
- **Human-in-the-loop AI development**
- **AI-assisted coding with validation and refinement**
- **Applied generative AI for productivity, not autonomy**
- **Structured development and review workflows**
---
## Technical Stack
- Python
- Generative AI / LLM APIs
- Modular application structure
- Version control with GitHub

## Development Approach
1. Define system requirements and architecture manually
2. Use generative AI tools to assist with code drafting
3. Review, test, and refine AI-generated outputs
4. Integrate validated code into the application
5. Track changes and iterations through version control

## Notes
This project is intended to demonstrate **applied AI engineering practices** rather than fully autonomous AI systems. All AI-generated outputs are reviewed and modified by a human developer prior to use.
